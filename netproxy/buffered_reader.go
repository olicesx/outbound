// BufferedReaderConn wraps a Conn with a bufio.Reader so that callers using
// io.ReadFull on small, frequent reads (chunk headers, nonces, length prefixes)
// do not each incur their own syscall. Without this wrapper, every protocol
// that frames data into chunks (shadowsocks, vmess, trojan, vless, ...) ends
// up doing at least two reads per chunk: one for the 2-byte length+tag and one
// for the payload. On a raw TCP socket each Read may hit the kernel, doubling
// the syscall count compared to what dae's relay loop issues on the write side.
//
// The default buffer is sized to hold a full protocol decryption chunk so
// io.ReadFull(header) plus io.ReadFull(payload) complete from one underlying
// read once data is flowing. Shadowsocks AEAD max chunk is ~16.1 KiB
// (16383 B payload + length + two AEAD tags); VMess MaxChunkSize is 16 KiB.
// 16 KiB is just short of a max SS chunk. 32 KiB matches dae's relay copy
// unit and leaves slack for tags. SS2022's theoretical 64 KiB-1 max is rare;
// the relay writes 32 KiB, so a typical encrypted chunk still fits.
//
// This buffer is per proxied raw-TCP session, not per node. TLS-like
// underlays (*tls.Conn, *utls.UConn, and any Conn that already exposes a
// TLS record buffer) already coalesce small io.ReadFull calls from their
// decrypted record buffer (maxPlaintext = 16 KiB). Wrapping those again
// would hold an extra live allocation for the connection lifetime and add
// a memcpy without reducing syscalls. NewBufferedReaderConn therefore
// returns such conns unchanged.
const defaultReadBufferSize = 32 << 10

// AlreadyReadBuffered is implemented by connections whose Read already
// coalesces from an internal buffer (typically a TLS record layer). Protocol
// dialers wrap every underlay with NewBufferedReaderConn; implement this on

// BufferedReaderConn embeds the original Conn and routes Read through a
// per-connection pooled buffered reader. All other Conn methods (Write,
// deadlines) pass straight through to the underlying Conn, so Write
// semantics and any SO_MARK / socket options set on the raw fd are
// preserved unchanged.
//
// Buffer lifecycle: the backing array comes from the shared byte pool and is
// returned exactly once, by whichever of two paths finds the read loop over
// with no reader left inside reader.Read:
//
//   - Read observed a terminal error (EOF, net.ErrClosed, cancellation) and
//     the buffered window is drained: the read loop's own exit path;
//   - Close ran with no read in flight and nothing buffered: a connection
//     torn down without a draining read.
//
// Retryable errors (notably read-deadline timeouts) release nothing, so
// timeout-retry loops keep their buffer. A connection abandoned without Close
// or a terminal read keeps its buffer for GC, which is the pre-pooling
// behavior. Every release requires an empty buffered window, so no readable
// byte is ever discarded. A panic raised inside reader.Read by a misbehaving
// underlay leaves the reader count raised, so the array is never returned:
// that failure mode loses one array to GC, it can never recycle one that a
// read might still be touching.
//
// Read and ReadBuffered share the connection's reader side — bufio.Reader
// itself is not safe for concurrent use — while Close may be called from any
// goroutine, including one racing a blocked read: it only closes the underlay
// and leaves the release to the unblocked reader.
