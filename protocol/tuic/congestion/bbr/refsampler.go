// congestion controller can share one implementation instead of carrying a
// second, divergent copy.
//
// It is a thin adapter over bandwidthSampler plus the max-bandwidth windowed
// filter, wired exactly the way bbrSender consumes them (bbr_sender.go:427-441):
//
//	sample := sampler.OnCongestionEvent(eventTime, acked, lost, maxBandwidth.GetBest(), bandwidthEstimate(), roundTripCount)
//	if totalBytesAcked changed && (!sample.sampleIsAppLimited || sample.sampleMaxBandwidth > maxBandwidth.GetBest()) {

//	}
//
// The adapter deliberately owns the filter as well: the reference sender feeds
// the same filter from its own round counter, and a caller that re-implemented
// the update rule would be re-introducing the divergence this type exists to
// remove.
//
// It owns the send-record reclamation for the same reason. Removing records
// that can no longer produce a sample is an obligation of the connection-state
// map, not a decision of the caller, so OnCongestionEvent performs it: a
// consumer that forgot would retain one record per send for the life of the
// connection.
